# PasswordGenerator
Its a GUI for a password generator. Because mashing you hand on the keyboard is not as random as you think. 

You select the strength of the password that you want to generate. These are categorised into four slections:
1. Strong   Uses all keyboard characters available to most of the world.
2. Medium   Uses all uppercase and lower case letters and numbers. 
3. Weak     Uses upper and lowercase letters only. 
4. Numeric  Only uses numbers. 

Additionally, you can select the length of the password by inputing the length into a text box. 
See the screenshots for a better idea.
